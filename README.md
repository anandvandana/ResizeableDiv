# ResizeableDiv
This is a simple jquery based UI component to creates a readable/re-sizeable divs.

One of my friend has a hard time getting a browser compatible, re-sizeable , readonly content area.
jQuery UI's resizeable() does the job but in IE its changing the CSS properties and again HTML 5 div resize property
also works fine but not with IE .

Hence I created this project using jQuery and jQuery UI (draggable property). 
I have tested it in IE up to 5 version in compatibility mode , seems to work fine. But the real results 
still relies on the actual browser.

For using it one can directly download it and follow the text.html which is the actual working of code.

I still find hard to adjust the width and height of the DIV and also the resize image doesnot move fluently.
Please feel free to make any required changes or optimize the code.
